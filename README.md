# Achievement 3: SQL for Data Analysts

## Project Overview

This project focused on developing SQL queries to analyze a dataset related to a retail business. The primary goal was to extract meaningful insights from the database to support business decision-making processes.

### Key Objectives:
- Write complex SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data from the database.
- Use joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions to perform detailed analysis.
- Create views to simplify complex query logic for future use.
- Optimize SQL queries to improve performance.

### Datasets:
- **Retail Sales Data**: Contains information about transactions, products, and customer details.

### SQL Techniques Applied:
- **Joins**: Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, and Full Outer Join.
- **Subqueries**: Used for nested queries to filter and aggregate data.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Used for organizing and simplifying complex queries.
- **Window Functions**: For ranking, cumulative totals, and moving averages.

### Tools Used:
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- GitHub for version control and collaboration

### Results:
The SQL queries developed in this project provided critical insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management, which can be used by the business to improve decision-making and operational efficiency.
